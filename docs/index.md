# WordSiv

WordSiv is a Python library for generating proofing text for an incomplete typeface using word probabilities.

Say you've drawn `HAMBUGERFONTSIVhambugerfontsiv.,` and want a sentence with *only* those glyphs:

```python
--8<-- "intro-example.py"
```

This returns something like:

>Bears run saint that fighting bargain remove, genre MA Barbara registration the bug it others entering Steven.

## Key Features

- **Shaped text**: WordSiv generates text that is roughly the *shape* of the desired language using word/punctuation probabilities and capitalization.
- **Word filtering**: WordSiv selects from words that can be spelled with your current glyph set. Many additional filters to select for letter combinations you want without worrying about `.notdef`.
- **Letter case support**: WordSiv supports cased source words, and has many ways of filtering and transforming case via the `case` parameter.

# Installation

### Installing in DrawBot

1. In the DrawBot menu, click **Python->Install Python Packages**:

2. Enter ```git+https://github.com/tallpauley/wordsiv``` and click **Go!**

!!! note

    You'll see some red text but it's nothing to worry about!

### Installing Outside of DrawBot (advanced)

You can also install WordSiv on your system and use it in any Python script. You'll probably want to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or a [tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/16qz8mx/pipenv_piptools_pdm_or_poetry/) that manages these for you, but I'll leave that up to you!

First make sure you have Python 3.9+. Then:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tallpauley/wordsiv
```

## Why Simple Word Probability?

Proofing text doesn't necessarily have to be syntactically correct or have meaning. It just needs the right amount of common and uncommon words to give it a "realistic" *shape*. Often type designers do this manually, such as in Jonathan Hoefler's fantastic [proof](https://jonathanhoefler.com/articles/how-to-proof-a-typeface):
>Finally, I wanted the text to have the visual cadences of my native English, in which words of variable but digestible length are punctuated by shorter ones.

If we simply select words randomly, out of a hat which contains many more duplicates of say, "the" than "etymology", we'll get a string of words which visually resembles a sentence. This is how WordSiv works: sampling words from a *probability distribution* which is determined by the occurence counts of words in a corpus of text.

Of course, the more we restrict our glyph set the more we've tampered with the natural distribution of words, since most the longer, less-common words aren't available (which make up the long tail of the [Zipf distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law#Word_frequencies_in_natural_languages)). However, we can blend in a bit of randomness to make it look like real text at a glance!

This might be *more fun* [with LLMs](#other-resources), because the glyph-limited text could potentially be both grammatically and semantically correct. However, it remains to be seen if stability can be achieved while filtering out the majority of tokens. And more importantly, why spend so much more compute for so little payoff?
