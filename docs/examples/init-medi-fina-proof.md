# Init, Medi, Fina Proof Example

[José Solé](https://jmsole.cl/) modified WordSiv 0.1.0 to work with Arabic and Persian, and created
a useful script to showcase letters in their `init` (start of word), `medi`
(inside word), `fina` (end of word), and `isol` (by itself) forms.

This example shows how WordSiv 0.2.0+ can support this use case:

```python
--8<-- "init-medi-fina.py"
```
