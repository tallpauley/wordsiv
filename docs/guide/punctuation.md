# Punctuation

Punctuation occurs with frequencies derived from real texts. However, you can adjust `rand_punc` to make any punctuation occur with equal probability:

```python
--8<-- "punctuation-randomness.py"
```

You can also turn off punctuation completely:

```python
--8<-- "punctuation-off.py"
```
