# WordSiv

WordSiv is a Python library/framework for generating text  with on a limited glyph set for [proofing typefaces](https://ohnotype.co/blog/proof-it). Here is an example using simple word probability from a huge corpus of books:
```python
>>> from wordsiv import set_model, sent
>>> set_model('en_prob_books')
>>> sent(glyphs='HAMBUGERFONTSIVhambugerfontsiv.,')
'A reform about for beer environment to the ease movie this if not no the on.'
```

## Why?

When designing a typeface, it's important to evaluate the typeface in text while the glyph set is limited. Tools like [word-o-mat](https://github.com/ninastoessinger/word-o-mat) are great for evaluating words, but lack the ability to make "realistic-looking" text which is punctuated by common words.

Also, I felt the need for an easy-to-use, extensible library for word/text generation to drop into [DrawBot](https://www.drawbot.com/) for dynamic type proof creation.


## Installation in DrawBot

1. Install the `wordsiv` package via **Python->Install Python Packages**:
     - Enter ```git+https://github.com/tallpauley/wordsiv``` and click **Go!**
     - ***Note:*** you'll probably see lots of red text but it
       should still work just fine

2. Install the desired Source packages in the same window:

    ```git+http://github.com/tallpauley/wordsiv-sources```

3. You can now 


## Installation

First, install wordsiv with pip:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/tallpauley/wordsiv # byexample: +pass
```

Then install some **sources**:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tallpauley/wordsiv-sources
```
